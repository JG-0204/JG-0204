### Hi there 👋, I am a rock, A rock that is trying to learn web development.

I'm trying to escape a real life loop.

Do something productive - get into a 10-15 day streak - feel like shit - waste time for 60 days - feel like shit - Do something productive 

Skills: mediocre JS

- 🌱 I’m currently learning REACT through Full Stack Open 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting things done 
- 💬 Ask me about wasting time 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I waste time for a living 


added github streaks to try and end my loop and for fun ig
