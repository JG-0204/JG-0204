## 👋 Hi, I'm James! I've been learning web development for about a year now, mainly focusing on JavaScript. 

#### I'm currently taking the online course FullStackOpen.

🛠️ My go-to tools:

- GitHub for version control
- Visual Studio Code for coding
- Postman for API testing (used briefly in a project requirement, exploring)
- Cypress for code quality (used briefly in a project requirement, exploring)

🌱 I'm driven by a passion for lifelong learning and personal development, always seeking out new opportunities to grow and contribute positively.
